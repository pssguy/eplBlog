# Bookdown

[bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) is an R package using RMarkdown making it relatively easy to createa book available in multiple outputs. It is extensively documented in the book, [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

To quote its author, Yihui Xie,

> It should be technically easy to write a book, visually pleasant to view the book, fun to interact with the book, convenient to navigate through the book, straightforward for readers to contribute or leave feedback to the book author(s), and more importantly, authors should not always be distracted by typesetting details.
