The World Bank is a great source of economic and social data.  A couple of years ago, I created a [shiny app](https://mytinyshinys.shinyapps.io/worldBank/) which still appears to work!

Earlier this year, the World Bank launched a new open data platform which collates more than 2000 indices from 40+ data sources many external to the World Bank
Even better, there is now an R package [data360r](https://github.com/mrpsonglao/data360r) to access the API and deliver data in a tidy format. [Reg Onglao](Reg Onglao) is its author and maintainer and she has written an introductory blog post on the [World Bank Site](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/introducing-data360r-data-power-r#comment-4262). There are further examples on github. The package also provides access to [Governance Global Practice indices](https://govdata360.worldbank.org/)

Rummage around on the World Bank site for access to thousands of reports and explanations for how the data is collected

 
Let's take it for a ride

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE)
```


```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

library(data360r)


```

## metadata

The get_metadata360() function downloads the requested TC/Govdata360 metadata, such as:

 * 'countries' == Lists metadata for all countries and regions.
 * 'indicators' == Lists metadata for all indicators. Does not return actual data.
 * 'datasets' == Lists metadata for all datasets.
 
```{r}
## get all and 
(df_indicators <- get_metadata360(metadata_type = "indicators"))



# above uses list colums for time frame and vizualizations 

#get all country metadata in TCdata360
#(df_countries <- get_metadata360(metadata_type = 'countries')) #217x13 inc some landlocked countrues which is bit of surprise

#get all dataset metadata in TCdata360
#(df_datasets <- get_metadata360(metadata_type = 'datasets')) #82x7 not just world bank as sourcs

```
