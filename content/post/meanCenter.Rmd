One of the perennial fun facts that the US census bureau produces the [Mean center of the United States population] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_center_of_the_United_States_population#cite_ref-zakrewsky_10-0)

This has been calculated since 1790 and has moved significantly west and- to a lesser amount west - over the years from Kent Conty Maryland to
Texas County, missouri

I thought I would use the tidycensus packages to broadly replicate this but also look at race differences - so I will

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus) 


library(leaflet)
library(stringr)
library(sf)
library(tigris)

library(feather) 

# recall census key - get your own with census_api_key() function - see documentation
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")

tracts <- readRDS("data/usCensus/tracts_sf.rds")
```




```{r, echo=FALSE}
# have now put into .Renviron but not working currently
#census_api_key("90ed3a1873a3356d6567fcb2af52ccbf68e32b60")

#Your API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")
```


Now lets download the information we require - I'm actully using the same race-related tables as in a previous post, but others could be used if more pertinent. It takes just under a minute to download 500,000+ rows

```{r}

# the function needs a parameter with a vector of states. We need them all
st <- c(datasets::state.abb) # excludes Dc
st <- c(st,"DC")

tables <- c("P0030002","P0030003","P0030004","P0030005","P0030006","P0030007","P0030008")

# previously accessed and saved data
# us_tract_pop_2010<-get_decennial(geography = "tract", variables = tables, 
#                                  summary_var = "P0030001", state = st, geometry = FALSE)  ###511399
# 
# write_feather(us_tract_pop_2010,"data/usCensus/us_tract_pop_2010.feather")
us_tract_pop_2010 <- read_feather("data/usCensus/us_tract_pop_2010.feather")

## add the geometry for each tract

#us_tract_pop_2010 <- geo_join(tracts,us_tract_pop_2010,by="GEOID", how = "inner")
glimpse(us_tract_pop_2010)

```

We now need to apply the population in each tract, with the assumption that the population is at the geographical cente of each tract. We can use an sf function st_centroid() to sitch the geometry from a MULTIPOLYGON to a latitude and longitude

```{r}

x <- st_centroid(tracts)

tracts_df <- tracts
st_geometry(tracts_df) <- NULL


latlon <- do.call(rbind, unclass(st_geometry(x))) %>%
            as.tibble() %>% 
            rename(lat=V1,lon=V2)

tracts_df <-  cbind(tracts_df,latlon)
glimpse(tracts_df)

```

You will see the warning that may have some impact. However, this is not a strict academic exercise

We now need to apply the lat lon data weighted by population of each tract to get an overall for the 50 states+DC

```{r}

tract_info <- us_tract_pop_2010 %>% 
  select(GEOID,NAME,pop=summary_value) %>% 
  left_join(tracts_df,by="GEOID")

midpoint_tract_all <-tract_info %>% 
  summarize(meanlat=weighted.mean(lat,pop,na.rm=TRUE),meanlon=weighted.mean(lon,pop,na.rm=TRUE))

midpoint_tract_all 

```

This comapares with the official -92.173096 and 37.517534
Let's map them and gauge the difference

```{r}


leaflet(data = midpoint_tract_all) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(-92.08842	,37.51626	,zoom = 12) %>% 
addMarkers(
        -92.08842, 37.51626,
         popup = "calculated"
        ) %>% 
    addMarkers(
        -92.173096,37.517534,
         popup = "official"
        )

library(geosphere)
distm(c(-92.08842, 37.51626), c(-92.173096, 37.517534), fun = distHaversine)
```

So pretty close. Going to the block level (of which there are over 11million would be more precise but excessively time-consuming
)

## Race differences

We have already downloaded tables by race - where  those have stipulated a single race only
If you go to previous post you can see from table the labels. Many of the some other race alone will be ethnically Hispanic, apparantly

![](img/raceOptions.png)

Lets see how these vary within the country

```{r}

# 
ids <- c("P0030002","P0030003","P0030004","P0030005","P0030006","P0030007")
labels <- c("White","Black of African American","American indian or Alaskan Native","Asian","Pacific Islander","Other Race")

race_df <- as_data_frame(list(id=tables,category=labels))


## amend previous code to a function but replace summary_value with value
get_latlon <- function(id) {
 
tract_info <- us_tract_pop_2010 %>% 
  filter(variable==id) %>% 
  select(GEOID,NAME,pop=value) %>% 
  left_join(tracts_df,by="GEOID")



tract_info %>% 
  summarize(meanlat=weighted.mean(lat,pop,na.rm=TRUE),meanlon=weighted.mean(lon,pop,na.rm=TRUE))

}


data <-map_df(ids, get_latlon)
# Add the census labels
data <- bind_cols(data,category=labels)

# Map - with labels showing
data %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
   addTiles() %>% 
  setView(-103, 35, 4) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = ~meanlat, lat=~meanlon,
             label=~category,
             labelOptions=labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = "right",
                                       textOnly = TRUE,
                                       style=list("color"="blue")))


```

As for the National average, the 'White' mean is also in Missouri as the 'Black' eastward pull is offset by the other categories

On average, people who designate themselves as 'Native Hawaiin and other Pacific islanders  alone' live in the water. Here is the breakdown by state. Most Hawaiins designate themselves as mixed race but their extreme distance from mainland USA cuases this impact

```{r}


us_tract_pop_2010 %>% 
  filter(variable=="P0030006") %>% 
  mutate(stateID = str_sub(GEOID,1,2)) %>% 
  group_by(stateID) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(pop=n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop)) %>% 
  mutate(cumPop=cumsum(pop),pct=round(100*cumPop/max(cumPop),0)) %>% 
  left_join(tracts_df,by=c("stateID"="state_code")) %>% 
  select(state=state_name,pop,cum_pct=pct) %>%
  unique() %>% 
                         DT::datatable(class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging = TRUE, searching = TRUE,info=FALSE))
