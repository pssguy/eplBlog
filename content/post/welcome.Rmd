Some of you may be familiar with the [mytinyshinys site](http://www.mytinyshinys.com)

i have decided to create a separate blog which will concentrate predominantly on the English Premier League, which is currently just completing its 25th season

The blog will include code and may help those interested in the exploratory process I go through in creating apps and charts for tweets

I also maintain a comprehensive shiny [interactive website](http://www.premiersoccerstats.com) covering teams and players throughout the history of the league

For those of you interested in creating a similar styled blog, please refer to *Yihui Xie & Amber Thomas's* [detailed documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and a useful blog post by [Ed Borasky](https://www.znmeb.mobi/2017/05/12/getting-started-with-blogdown/) on setting up a similar-themed site
