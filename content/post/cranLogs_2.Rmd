# CRAN packages


I mentioned in an earlier post that I like to keep track of new and updated packages 

On average, a new package is provided to  CRAN every 5 hours and updates are even more numerous

CRAN provides an [availablity table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) and 
there is also the informative [CRANberries site](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/) plus twitter announcements but it is still hard to  keep track of all the new developments


So I created a [dashboard](https://mytinyshinys.shinyapps.io/cranlogsFlexDB/) which is updated daily and provides a taster of the new. Because it has interactive inputs (e.g. selection of package name ) using shiny runtime, it takes somewhat longer to run than if there were htmlwidget inputs available

Here is an example of one of the outputs comparing downloads of a selection of interactive packages over time. It is a large file so is limited to the selected packages


```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(feather)
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)

# The choices can be amended in the actual app
choices <-
c("rbokeh", "ggvis", "plotly", "iplots", "rggobi", "googlevis")
# Pre prepared limited data of above choices
df <- read_feather("data/selectCranLogs.feather")


df %>%
filter(package %in% choices) %>%
plot_ly(x = ~ date,
y = ~ count) %>%
add_markers(color = ~ package) %>%
layout(
title = "Daily Downloads from CRAN",
xaxis = list(title = ""),
yaxis = list(title = "Count")
) %>%
config(displayModeBar = F, showLink = F)


```

Needs work!

However, it does show that the intensive work on the plotly package - covered in a [book](https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/) by the author of the package, Carson Sievert - has contributed to its popularity which spiked at the end of the period with a new release
