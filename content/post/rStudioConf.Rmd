Just a quick reminder that the second [rstudio conference](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) to be held in Florida in January is almost sold out (32 tickets available at time of writing)

Needless to say, a great chance to network as well as take in some interesting talks

Probably will not be going myself. As a white male, I might be forced to stay in the country and become a citizen!
