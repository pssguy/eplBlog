# Wild boars amongst us

One of the great virtues of R Notebooks is the ease of collaboration and [Tuija Sonkkila](https://twitter.com/ttso) recently kindly made hers [on wild boars](http://tuijasonkkila.fi/wildboar.html) available  

As - in a former existence - I was a pork buyer for a grocery chain, this piqued (almost-pun intended) my interest. So I just hit the code > Download Rmd button, and opened the resulting notebook file in RStudio to play with. It introduced me to a new package I needed to install, [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar), which is useful for identifying, plotting and summarising missing data.

After contacting her, Tuija posted her [dataset](https://github.com/tts/villisika/blob/master/SpeciesObservations.xlsx), I added one line from leaflet to cluster some of the many data-points and reposted on [rpubs](https://rpubs.com/pssguy/241602)

Easy-Peasy
