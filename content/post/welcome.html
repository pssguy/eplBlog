<p>Some of you may be familiar with the <a href="http://www.mytinyshinys.com">mytinyshinys site</a></p>
<p>i have decided to create a separate blog which will concentrate predominantly on the English Premier League, which is currently just completing its 25th season</p>
<p>The blog will include code and may help those interested in the exploratory process I go through in creating apps and charts for tweets</p>
<p>I also maintain a comprehensive shiny <a href="http://www.premiersoccerstats.com">interactive website</a> covering teams and players throughout the history of the league</p>
<p>For those of you interested in creating a similar styled blog, please refer to <em>Yihui Xie &amp; Amber Thomasâ€™s</em> <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">detailed documentation</a> and a useful blog post by <a href="https://www.znmeb.mobi/2017/05/12/getting-started-with-blogdown/">Ed Borasky</a> on setting up a similar-themed site</p>
