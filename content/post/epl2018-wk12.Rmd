## Match of the Day

Following a defeat to North London rivals, Spurs now talking top 4, not title

## Pulis is out

Stodgy football and a points-per-game average lower than Steve Clarke will do that for you. His spell
at WBA ended with the lowest ppg average of any of his three clubs. The Welsh managership may come calling

<p class="factoid">Already equalling a season-best 7 assists, Azpilicueta has cracked the all-time Top 20 for defenders; but he still has 5 Chelsea players ahead of him</p>

## Flat Track Bullies

With Pogba back and against moderate opposition, United were once again big winners. Lukaku ended his EPL goal drought at 434 minutes - coincidentally the exact period before his final goal for Everton

Although they are not quite keeping pace with Man City at the head of the table, Man United have recorded more games with at least four goals- in their case exactly four. 

Here is a chart showing their progress in comparison with other clubs that have started as strongly as them. Hover for details

```{r}


best <- standings %>% 
  filter(GF>3) %>% 
  group_by(team,season) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(n==max(n)) %>% 
  left_join(standings) %>% 
  arrange(gameDate) %>% 
  select(team,season,tmYrGameOrder,GF) %>% 
  group_by(team,season) %>%
  mutate(yes=ifelse(GF>3,1,0),count=cumsum(yes))

manU <- standings %>% 
  filter(season=="2017/18"&team=="Man. Utd.") %>% 
  left_join(standings) %>% 
  arrange(gameDate) %>% 
  select(team,season,tmYrGameOrder,GF) %>% 
  #group_by(team,season) %>%
  mutate(yes=ifelse(GF>3,1,0),count=cumsum(yes))

all <- bind_rows(best,manU) 

# all leaders after round 12
temp12 <-standings %>% 
  filter(GF>3&tmYrGameOrder<=12) %>% 
  group_by(team,season) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% # otherwise does not match overall n
  filter(n==max(n)) %>% 
  left_join(standings) %>% 
  arrange(gameDate) %>% 
  select(team,season,tmYrGameOrder,GF) %>% 
  group_by(team,season) %>%
  mutate(yes=ifelse(GF>3,1,0),count=cumsum(yes))

# put grey before colors (which dont work) so latter take precedence
plot_ly(data=temp12,x=~tmYrGameOrder,y=~count) %>% 
    add_lines(color=I("lightgrey"), line=list(shape= "hv"),
              hoverinfo="text", name="Other Round 12 leaders",
              text= ~paste0(team," ", season,"<br>",
                            count," after ",tmYrGameOrder," games")) %>% 
  add_lines(data=all,x=~tmYrGameOrder,y=~count,color=~team,colors=c("red","lightblue","black"),  line=list(shape= "hv"),
            hoverinfo="text", 
            text= ~paste0(team," ", season,"<br>",
                          count," after ",tmYrGameOrder," games")) %>% 
    layout(xaxis=list(title="Games Played"),
           yaxis=list(title="Four goal Wins")) %>%  config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F)
```

The Liverpool side with the SSS strike-force of Suarez, Sterling and Sturridge backed up by Gerrard, Coutinho and Henderson ran up four goal tallies an amazing 11 times in a run of 24 games

<p class="factoid">With 12 assists to date, Kevin de Bruyne still leads the EPL table - three ahead of team-mante, David Silva - but has not registered one in last three outings</p>

```{r results}
## results - amy have to copy and run in console
hth %>% 
  filter(season=="2017/18"&gameDate>="2017-11-08"&gameDate<="2017-11-21") %>% ## may need to put in day later?
  filter(venue=="H") %>% 
  arrange(team) %>% 
  select(Home=team,GF,GA,Away=OppTeam) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames=FALSE,class='compact stripe hover row-border',colnames = c('', '', '', ''),
                options= list(paging = FALSE, searching = FALSE,info=FALSE,
                              columnDefs = list(list(width = '40%', targets = list(0,3)))),width=250)
```



```{r standings}


# table
hth %>% 
  filter(season=="2017/18"&gameDate<="2017-11-21") %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% 
  mutate(W = ifelse(res=="Win",1,0),L = ifelse(res=="Loss",1,0),D = ifelse(res=="Draw",1,0)) %>%
  summarise(P=n(),Pts=sum(points),W=sum(W),D=sum(D),L=sum(L),GD=sum(GF)-sum(GA),GF=sum(GF)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Pts),desc(GD),desc(GF),team) %>%
  DT::datatable(class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',colnames = c('', 'P', 'Pts', 'W','D', 'L', 'GD','GF'),
                rownames=TRUE,options= list(paging = FALSE, searching = FALSE,info=FALSE))


```




## Final Factoid

<p class="factoid">Man. Utd's go-ahead goal came via a left footed cross from Ashley Young.
He never scores with it though. All 43 of his EPL goals have been with right foot</p>
