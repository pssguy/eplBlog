Amongst interactive chart options for R, plotly (aided by its wrapper function for ggplot2) is the pre-eminent, interactive chart 

![](img/cranPlots.png)

 

Carson Sievert has been the driving force behind development of the package and he recently held a [webinar](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/plotly-for-R/register) to supplement the excellent under development [book](https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/)

Here I am focusing on a couple of functions to aid highlighting and provide animation using some English soccer data



## Goal Scoring in the Premier League

 Firstly, the add_fun() function to easily highlight specific lines. The equivalent coverage from his book can be found [here](https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/a-case-study-of-housing-sales-in-texas.html)

Manchester United won 13 of the first 21 Premier League titles but have struggled over the past four seasons in spite of
spending a shedload of cash on transfer fees and salaries. This chart highlights their continuing struggle to score goals

---

First load libraries and import one dataset which tracks each teams' league position by round of competition

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
library(crosstalk)
library(htmltools)

#load and display dataset
standings <- readRDS("data/standings.rds")
glimpse(standings)

```

The fields Of interest are team, season, tmYrGameOrder (the number of games played) and cumGF (the cumulative number of Goals scored).    

 With 25 lines to show, it is probably inappropriate to apply a color to each season, although plotly offers the option to toggle lines on/off by clicking the legend. Let's just start with a a barebones example which, on hovering,  shows the x and y axis information

```{r basic, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Limit to one team and group dataset for subsequent highlighting
allYears <- standings %>% 
  filter(team=="Man. Utd.") %>% 
  group_by(season) 

# create and display line chart
p <-allYears %>% 
  plot_ly(x=~tmYrGameOrder,y=~cumGF) %>% 
  add_lines(color=I('lightgrey'))


p



```

---

I would to enhance this initial plot in three respects

* Highlight specific seasons
* Improve tooltip to show hovered season
* Tidy up look of chart

Of these, the one of major new interest is the first where a function can be created and applied. I wish to highlight the latest two years to compare the impact of new manager Mourinho and a bunch of new players with the turgid football under the previous top dog, van Gaal 

```{r add_functions, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# function with one variable, season and enhanced tooltip

layer_season <- function(plot, name) {
  plot %>% filter(season == name) %>% add_lines(name = name,
                                                hoverinfo="text",
                                                text=~paste0(season,
                                                             "<br>Pl: ",tmYrGameOrder,
                                                             "<br>Gls: ",cumGF))
}

# Set title font characteristics
t <- list(
  family = "sans serif",
  size = 18,
  color = 'red')

## plot all years
p <-allYears %>% 
  plot_ly(x=~tmYrGameOrder,y=~cumGF) %>% 
  add_lines(color=I('lightgrey'), name="EPL Seasons",
            hoverinfo="text",
            text=~paste0(season,
                         "<br>Pl: ",tmYrGameOrder,
                         "<br>Gls: ",cumGF)) %>% 
## highlight last two years  
  add_fun(layer_season,"2015/16") %>% 
  add_fun(layer_season,"2016/17") %>% 
## Improve layout  
  layout(hovermode="closest",
    title="Man. Utd. Cumulative Goals-For by Game by PL Season",
    titlefont=t,
         xaxis=list(title="Games Played"),
         yaxis=list(title="Goals Scored")) %>% 
   config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F)
p

```

So an improvement over last year but at the time of writing (after 31 games) still the worst output bar last season    
 _N.B. As I update the standings file this will change_

I have previously touched on the [sharedData option](https://www.mytinyshinys.com/post/badDrivers_538/) and this can easily be adapted so that we can look at any of the 47 teams that have graced the Premier League, to date

Just press the down-button in the select box and choose a team

```{r sharedData, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


# Exclude filter for individual team
allTeamYears <- standings %>% 
  group_by(season,team) 



sd <- SharedData$new(allTeamYears)


fs <- filter_select(
id = "team",
label = "Select Team",
sharedData = sd,
group =  ~ team,
allLevels = FALSE,
multiple = FALSE
)


## this is needed as crosstalk does not work nicely with bootstrap, apparently
fs_nobootstrap <- fs

attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies") <- Filter(
  function(dep) {dep$name != "bootstrap"},
  attr(fs_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies")
)


 
 ## plot all years
 myChart  <-sd %>% 
  plot_ly(x=~tmYrGameOrder,y=~cumGF) %>% 
  add_lines(color=I('lightgrey'), name="EPL Seasons",
            hoverinfo="text",
            text=~paste0(season,
                         "<br>Pl: ",tmYrGameOrder,
                         "<br>Gls: ",cumGF)) %>% 
# highlight current season if team is in PL
   add_fun(layer_season,"2016/17") %>% 
## Improve layout  
  layout(hovermode="closest",
    title="Cumulative Goals-For by Game by PL Season",
    titlefont=t,
         xaxis=list(title="Games Played"),
         yaxis=list(title="Goals Scored")) %>% 
   config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F)



## combine the selector and chart

 
  tagList(
  fs_nobootstrap,
  br(),
   myChart
)





```



## Animation

One of the enduring (and endearing if you are a Gooner) features of the the EPL is that although the two North London rivals, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, havebeen two of the six ever-presents of the division, the former have almost always come out on top.     
 In the earlier part of this year, it appeared as though it would be the same old-same old but Spurs have motored ahead in recent weeks. This appeared to be a good option to apply the [animation features](https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/key-frame-animations.html) of plotly
 
 Carson responded swiftly to a [github request](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/issues/957) for cumulative animation



```{r final, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# function to add cumulative line
accumulate_by <- function(dat, var) {
  var <- lazyeval::f_eval(var, dat)
  lvls <- plotly:::getLevels(var)
  dats <- lapply(seq_along(lvls), function(x) {
    cbind(dat[var %in% lvls[seq(1, x)], ], frame = lvls[[x]])
  })
  dplyr::bind_rows(dats)
}

# example teams - could be any
teams <- c("Arsenal","Tottenham H")

# add function to base data
df <- standings %>% 
  filter(season=="2016/17"&team %in% teams) %>% 
  accumulate_by(~tmYrGameOrder)

# static plot
base <- df %>% 
  plot_ly(x=~tmYrGameOrder,y=~cumPts,
          hoverinfo="text",
          text=~paste0(team," ",GF,"-",GA," ",OppTeam,"<br>",gameDate,
                       "<br>PL:",tmYrGameOrder," Pts:",cumPts," Pos:",position)) %>% 
   config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F) %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis=list(title="Games Played"),
   yaxis=list(title="Points Accrued")
  )

#frame, ids = ~team)

# add animation options
base %>%
   add_lines(color = ~team, frame = ~frame, ids = ~team) %>%
  animation_opts(500, easing = "linear",mode='immediate') %>%
  animation_button(
    x = 1, xanchor = "right", y = 0, yanchor = "bottom", font = list(color="red"), bgcolor="yellow"
  ) %>%
  animation_slider(
    currentvalue = list(prefix = "Game ")
  ) 

```

Just press buton to see how teams have progressed over the season and hover for more details    
 
Enhancements would include option to select other teams and seasons

Not on page - appears to work fine with 2 inputs given that they are grouped. However, probably not appropriate
where one factor e.g. seasons selectable depends on first e.g. team - though no error ias shown just blank

```{r sharedData2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


# Exclude filter for individual team
allTeamYears <- standings %>% 
  group_by(season,team) 



sd <- SharedData$new(allTeamYears)


fs_1 <- filter_select(
id = "team",
label = "Select Team",
sharedData = sd,
group =  ~ team,
allLevels = FALSE,
multiple = FALSE
)


## this is needed as crosstalk does not work nicely with bootstrap, apparently
fs_1_nobootstrap <- fs_1

attr(fs_1_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies") <- Filter(
  function(dep) {dep$name != "bootstrap"},
  attr(fs_1_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies")
)

fs_2 <- filter_select(
id = "season",
label = "Select Season",
sharedData = sd,
group =  ~ season,
allLevels = FALSE,
multiple = FALSE
)


## this is needed as crosstalk does not work nicely with bootstrap, apparently
fs_2_nobootstrap <- fs_2

attr(fs_2_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies") <- Filter(
  function(dep) {dep$name != "bootstrap"},
  attr(fs_2_nobootstrap, "html_dependencies")
)


 
 ## plot all years
 myChart  <-sd %>%

  add_lines(color=I('lightgrey'), name="EPL Seasons",
            hoverinfo="text",
            text=~paste0(season,
                         "<br>Pl: ",tmYrGameOrder,
                         "<br>Gls: ",cumGF)) %>% 
# highlight current season if team is in PL
   add_fun(layer_season,"2016/17") %>% 
## Improve layout  
  layout(hovermode="closest",
    title="Cumulative Goals-For by Game by PL Season",
    titlefont=t,
         xaxis=list(title="Games Played"),
         yaxis=list(title="Goals Scored")) %>% 
   config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F)



## combine the selector and chart
